	This is where the organization for your pack happens, and where you can assign attributes on a categorical level
	If you're looking for information on attributes, the best place to start is: https://blishhud.com/docs/markers/development/attributes/


	This is your main category, e.g. your entire pack goes inside of this 
	 |    All marker categories have at least two attributes 
	 |         The 'name' attribute is how the category is referenced internally (in the 'type' attribute of a marker)
     |               | The 'displayName' attribute is what will be shown to the user when looking through categories
	 |               |            | 
     V               V            V -->
	<MarkerCategory name="" displayName="">
	
		<!-- This is an example of a sub-category -->
		<MarkerCategory name="" displayName="">
		
			<!-- This is an example of an actual marker
			      |    Markers have an additional 'iconFile' attribute, which is the path to what image will be used for that marker
			      |                                  |               Markers are closed with a '/' because they do not contain other markers
			      |                                  |                              |   
			      V                                  V                              V   -->

			<!-- This is an example of a trail category
				  |                                  Trails use the texture attribute instead of iconFile
				  |                                                    |     Trails also require fadeNear and fadeFar, which are when the trail starts to fade and completely disappears, respectively
				  |                                                    |              |               |
